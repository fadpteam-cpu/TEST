 "Will the report be accepted by lenders?","Reports are written to the evidential standard lenders ask for; where an engineer's signature is required, we coordinate it within the appointment.",None),

 "Works to shared walls, on the boundary, or excavating near a neighbour's structure engage the Party Wall etc. Act 1996: notices must be served, and where neighbours dissent, an award drawn up by surveyors.",
 "We manage the process as part of our projects, from notice drafting to coordinating appointed surveyors, sequenced so the award never delays the build. "+FF,
 ["Assessment of which works engage the Act","Notice drafting and service","Schedule of condition coordination","Award coordination with appointed surveyors"],
 "Notifiable works identified early in design.",
 "Notices served at the right time with the right drawings.",
 "Awards concluded before works begin.",
 "The Act is procedural: served correctly and early, it is routine; served late, it stops sites. It is a programme item, and we treat it as one.",
 "Do I always need a party wall agreement?","Only when your works are notifiable under the Act: cutting into a shared wall, building at the boundary, or excavating within 3 or 6 metres depending on depth. We assess this at design stage.",
 "What if my neighbour refuses to respond?","Silence counts as dissent under the Act, and the surveyor procedure resolves it without needing their cooperation. It is designed for exactly that case.",None),
S('boundary-dispute-solutions','Boundary Disputes','Measured evidence, plans and pragmatic resolution for boundary disagreements.','site',
 "Boundary disputes are settled by evidence: title plans, measured surveys, historic mapping and the physical record on the ground. Emotion extends them; documents end them.",
 "We produce the measured drawings and factual analysis that give a dispute something to settle on, and where wanted, proposals both sides can accept. "+FF,
 ["Measured survey of the boundary in question","Title and historic plan comparison","Factual report suitable for legal use","Boundary agreement drawings where resolution is reached"],
 "The boundary surveyed and the documents assembled.",
 "The evidence analysed and reported.",
 "Resolution documented, formally where required.",
 "Litigation over a fence line routinely costs more than the land is worth. Evidence early is the cheap exit.",
 "Can you tell me exactly where my boundary is?","We can tell you what the evidence supports, which is what a court would ask. Title plans alone are rarely precise; the survey and history together usually are.",
 "Do we need solicitors involved?","Not always. Many disputes settle on a factual report and an agreed plan. Where legal steps follow, the same documents serve as evidence.",None),
S('build-over-agreements','Build Over Agreements','Thames Water build-over approvals for works near public sewers, secured without derailing the programme.','model',
 "Building within 3 metres of a public sewer needs a build over agreement from the water company, with drawings showing how the sewer is protected. Miss it, and building control cannot sign the works off.",
 "We identify the sewer position at design stage and secure the agreement as part of the package. "+FF,
 ["Sewer location check at design stage","Foundation design respecting the asset","Build over application and drawings","Approval coordinated with building control"],
 "Sewer records checked before design is fixed.",
 "Foundations designed to the water company's requirements.",
 "Agreement secured ahead of works.",
 "Discovering a sewer during excavation is the expensive version of this service. The records check costs almost nothing and happens on every project we design.",
 "How do I know if a sewer crosses my garden?","Water company asset maps show public sewers, and since 2011 many formerly private drains are public. We obtain and interpret the records for your site.",
 "How long does a build over agreement take?","Straightforward self-certified cases are quick; approved agreements typically take a few weeks. We build it into the programme so it never becomes the critical path.",None),
S('outbuild-design','Outbuildings & Garden Rooms','Studios, offices and garden rooms designed under permitted development or planning, and built to be usable year-round.','p9',
 "Garden buildings fall under generous permitted development rights, capped at 2.5 metres high within 2 metres of a boundary, incidental use only, and not forward of the house.",

 ["PD check for your garden and any designations","Design to the height and use limits","Services, insulation and foundations specified","Planning application where PD does not apply"],
 "Rights and constraints checked for the plot.",
 "The building designed inside them.",
 "Specification, pricing and delivery support.",
 "'Incidental' use is the trap: a garden building used as a bedroom or separate dwelling breaches PD. We design and document use correctly so the building never becomes an enforcement case.",
 "Can I work from a garden office under PD?","Yes; home office use is treated as incidental. Sleeping accommodation or self-contained living is not, and needs permission.",
 "Do garden rooms need building regulations?","Under 15 square metres and non-sleeping, generally exempt; larger or serviced buildings may not be. We confirm for your design.",None),
S('sunroom','Sunrooms & Garden Rooms','Glazed additions designed for light without the greenhouse effect, consented by the right route.','p5',
 "A sunroom succeeds or fails on physics: orientation, glazing specification and ventilation decide whether it is a room you live in or a space you avoid for half the year.",
 "We design glazed additions as proper extensions, thermally modelled and consented under PD or planning as the design requires. "+FF,
 ["Orientation and overheating assessment","Glazing and ventilation specification","PD or planning route confirmed","Full technical package for construction"],
 "Site orientation and use assessed.",

 "Detailed, priced and delivered.",
 "South-facing glass without shading design is a greenhouse. The modelling that prevents it costs a fraction of the blinds that will not fix it.",
 "Is a sunroom permitted development?","Usually treated as an extension, so the standard extension limits apply. "+PD,
 "Will it be usable in winter?","Designed as a thermally compliant extension, yes. That is the difference between a sunroom and a conservatory, and it is a design decision.",'Extension'),
S('dropped-kerb','Dropped Kerbs & Crossovers','Vehicle crossover applications: council approval, highway specification and the planning cases where they apply.','p3',
 "A dropped kerb needs the highway authority's approval, and on classified roads or where a front garden becomes parking, planning permission can be required too, with drainage rules on new hardstanding.",
 "We prepare the application, the drawings and the drainage compliance so approval arrives once, not after rejections. "+FF,
 ["Highway and planning requirement check","Application drawings to council specification","Permeable drainage compliance for hardstanding","Submission and approval management"],
 "The road classification and requirements confirmed.",
 "Drawings prepared to the authority's standard.",
 "Application managed to approval.",
 "Hardstanding over 5 square metres draining to the road needs permeable construction or planning permission. It is the commonest rejection reason, and the easiest to design out.",
 "Do I need planning permission for a dropped kerb?","On classified roads, yes; elsewhere usually only highway approval, plus the drainage rules for the parking surface. We confirm your road's status first.",
 "Can the council refuse a crossover?","Yes, on visibility, trees, utilities or footway grounds. The application we prepare addresses the assessable criteria before submission.",None),
S('new-homes','New Build Homes','Individual houses designed from feasibility to completion: the full architectural service on a single instruction.','p1',
 "A new house is the complete discipline: site finding and feasibility, planning strategy, technical design, and delivery through a building contract, with every consent and duty holder role handled.",
 "We take new homes from first sketch to keys, with fixed fees per stage and a director leading throughout. "+FF,
 ["Feasibility and planning strategy for the site","Full design and planning application","Technical design, structure and regulations","Tender, contract administration and inspections"],
 "Site tested and the planning route established.",

 "Built under proper contract with our inspections.",
 "Self-build rewards preparation: the projects that finish well are the ones where planning risk, budget and buildability were faced in month one, not discovered in year two.",
 "Do you help find or assess plots?","Yes; pre-purchase feasibility on candidate plots is one of the most valuable things we do, and often prevents an expensive mistake.",
 "How long does a new house take?","Commonly 9 to 15 months of design and consents, then 12 months or more on site depending on scale. A written programme comes with the feasibility stage.",'New build'),
S('conservatory','Conservatories','Conservatories and glazed extensions, specified beyond the catalogue and consented correctly.','p5',

 ["PD and exemption condition check","Design and specification beyond standard systems","Thermal separation and heating compliance","Planning application where required"],
 "Rights and exemption conditions confirmed.",
 "The structure designed and specified.",
 "Consents and delivery managed.",
 "The building regulations exemption requires thermal separation from the house and independent heating controls; without them, the whole addition needs full compliance. Installers rarely mention this.",
 "Is a conservatory permitted development?","Usually, within the standard extension limits. "+PD,
 "Conservatory or proper extension?","If you want the space usable in January, an insulated glazed extension is the honest answer, and often costs less than expected against a large conservatory system.",'Extension'),
